## Library Management API built using Java Spring Boot

### Introduction

LibMan is a basic REST API built on top of Spring Boot and the Spring Framework. Below is a comprehensive list of dependencies used to develop LibMan API.
- [Spring Data JPA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jpa-introduction/): provides a standardized way to manage relational data in Java applications
- [Spring Web](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ws): creates document-driven web services and facilitates contract-first Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) service development
- [H2 Database](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spring-boot-with-h2-database/): supports CRUD operations with data stored in an embedded, open-source, in-memory database
- [Spring HATEOAS](https://spring.io/projects/spring-hateoas): provides APIs to aid in creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle
- [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): reduces boilerplate from repeated software design patterns within Java
- [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security): secures API endpoints by providing both authentication and authorization
- [Jakarta Validation](https://beanvalidation.org/): validates data sent to the application within server-defined DTOs
