### About this project

- [Spring Web](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ws): creates document-driven web services and facilitates contract-first Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) service development
- [H2 Database](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spring-boot-with-h2-database/): supports CRUD operations with data stored in an embedded, open-source, in-memory database
