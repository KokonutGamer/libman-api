## LibMan API: Barcode Encodings
Barcodes in LibMan API use the code 3 of 9 encoding (mod 43) for generating barcodes. The next sections specify how these codes are generated.

## Generating Barcodes
Using code 3 of 9, the following characters will be used as the result of the generated barcode:
- Uppercase alphabetic characters (A-Z)
- The digits 0-9
- The following special characters
  - Hyphen (-)
  - Dollar symbol ($)
  - Plus symbol (+)
  - Period (.)
  - Percentage symbol (%)
  - Forward slash (/)
  - Space ( )

All barcodes within the system are built using these components:
- Type indicator: a single character specifying the type of the item.
- Location code: a string of four characters specifying the school or district number for identification purposes.
- Item or patron number: a string of eight characters that uniquely identifies the item, whether it be a book, CD, DVD, patron, etc.
- Check digit: a single character generated by summing up the values of the corresponding characters in the rest of the barcode and finding the remainder using mod 10.

Below is a table specifing how barcodes are generated for the different item types (book copies and patrons) for LibMan API.

| Barcode Component | Book Copy Implementation | Library Card Implementation |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Type Indicator | The character 'B' | The character 'C' |
| Location Code | The building number | The building number |
| Item or Patron Number | Generated using mod 43 on the ISBN | Generated using mod 43 on the Camel Case combination of the patron's first and last name; truncated for the first eight characters |

> [!NOTE]
> The check digit is generated the same for both implementations.
